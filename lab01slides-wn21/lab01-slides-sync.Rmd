# Health and Well-Being

College is hard (especially now). **Your health and well-being are more important than this class.**

If you're struggling with mental health, there are resources available to you at [wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu](https://wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu). 

CAPS: [caps.umich.edu](https://caps.umich.edu) or 734.764.8312

*If you become ill, please report the illness to LSA: https://webapps.lsa.umich.edu/SAA/UGStuAdv/App/Illness/RptIll.aspx*

**Let me know what's going on and I'll do my best to help.**

---

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

It's important to me to cultivate a learning environment in which everyone's identities (race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.) are respected. To this end:
- If you feel that your performance in the class is being affected by experiences inside **or** outside the classroom, please let me know.
- DEI is a process: I (and many others) am still learning about different perspectives and identities. If anything is said in class (by anyone, including by me) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know.

---

# Is this a math class?

Statistics is a *mathematical science*. This course will involve elements of a typical math course, but also less typical aspects.

- Often, you will be required to apply statistical knowledge *and* everyday knowledge ("common sense") to solve problems.
- In statistics, there is not always a "correct" answer. You should be prepared to argue (in words) for why your answer is reasonable.
- Written components of assignments are critical.
- Statistics requires **context**: you need to tell me what numbers mean and why we care. *No context = no points.*

# Lab Goals and Structure

- **Overall goal:** Give you hands-on experience working with data in **R**, a powerful statistical computing tool.
  - You'll complete weekly lab assignments using **R Markdown** via **RStudio Cloud**.

## Typical Lab Structure
- **Tutorial** (~30 minutes): We'll walk through how to perform tasks in R together
  - iClicker engagement questions sprinkled throughout (extra credit!)
- **Collaboration** (~40 minutes): You'll work on the lab assignment in breakout rooms
- **Wrap-Up** (~10 minutes): We'll talk about any questions or issues and complete a brief reflection.

# Let's get started!

# Learning Objectives

1. Learn the difference between R, RStudio, and R Markdown
1. Become familiar with the RStudio interface 
1. Understand key components of an R Markdown document
1. Learn how to use R to do basic calculations
1. Learn how to import data into R and name objects

---
# Getting Started: What is R?

- Statisticians (that means you!) often use computers to analyze data. 
- **R** is a popular (and powerful) program for manipulating data, doing calculations, and making graphs.
- R works by writing **`R code`**.

### Wait omg is this a coding class???

Over the course of the semester, you'll learn how to edit and write some basic R code to help you analyze data to answer research questions. **This will always be through the lens of answering statistical questions.**

# What are all these "R" terms?
There are a lot of "R" words floating around. What's going on?

- **R** is a "statistical computing environment" that's designed for manipulating data, generating plots, and performing analyses. It's also a programming language. You'll be *using R* this semester.
--

- **R Studio** is an "integrated development environment (IDE)" for R (you'll never have to hear the term IDE again in this class). Basically, it's a pretty interface that makes working with R easier. You use R inside of R Studio. If R is ice cream, R Studio is the cone or cup.
--

- **R Markdown** is a way to write pretty analysis reports that combines R code, R output (plots, analysis results, etc.) and text in one document. This lab document is an R Markdown report!

# R Markdown

- Document creation interface
- Integrate text with R code, R output, and graphs
- Type code in **chunks**:

````md
`r ''````{r chunkName, <chunk options>}
# Type code here

```
````

--
### Common Error Alert!

- Make sure you have only **one** set of backticks at the beginning and end of a chunk
- Make sure each chunk has a **unique** name

# Using R as a Calculator

At its most basic, R is a fancy calculator.

Here's a code chunk in which we do some math:
````md
`r ''````{r calculatorExample}
5 * 7
```
````

Output:

```{r calculatorExample, echo = FALSE}
5 * 7
```

---

# Try it! (Line ~87)

In your R Markdown document, edit the code chunk that looks like this (line ~87) to compute 50 divided by 9:
````md
`r ''````{r tryItCalculator, error = T}
# Write code here! This text is a comment, so it's not run by R. 
# Replace it withcode to compute 50 divided by 9.
```
````

--
Solution:

```{r tryItCalculator}
50 / 9
```

---
# R Functions

- We'll be using R primarily by using *functions*.
  - These work just like math functions: they take inputs and return outputs
  
```{r genericFunction, eval = F}
function.name(argument1, argument2, ...)
```

- Arguments to functions go **inside** parentheses and are separated by commas
- **Finish what you started:** make sure you close parentheses you open!
- Don't put a space between the name of the function and the open parenthesis

---
# R "Assignment" Syntax (line ~104)

- Often, we want R to remember the results of a calculation so we can use it later.
- We can **assign** these results a name:

```{r assignmentDemo}
x <- 36 / 6
```

- Read `<-` as "gets": "x *gets* 36 divided by 6"

---
# R "Assignment" Syntax (line ~ 111)

```{r assignmentDemo}
```

Now we can ask R what `x` is:

```{r x}
x
```

**NOTE:** R is "case-sensitive", which means that upper-case letters are *different than* lower-case letters. Notice what happens when we ask R for the value of `X`:

```{r X, error = T}
X
```

---
# "Valid" Names in R
- Names can contain only letters, numbers, periods (`.`) and underscores (`_`). 
- Must start with a letter or period.

# CSV Files

- A common way to store data
- CSV = "**C**omma **S**eparated **V**alues"

```{r echo = F}
write.csv(head(read.csv("penguins.csv")), row.names = F)
```

- Each row is a *case* or *observation*
- Each column is a *variable*

# "Read in" data

```{r readData}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

- The `read.csv` function takes a CSV file and imports it into R.
- What name did we give the data in R?
- Don't worry about `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` right now.

---
# Peek at the first 6 rows of the data
```{r headPenguins}
head(penguins)
```

- Read this code as "head of penguins"

---
# View the `str`ucture of the data

```{r strPenguins}

# R Code Cheat Sheet

## `<-`
- Assigns a value to a name
- `name <- value`

---
# R Code Cheat Sheet

## `read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)`

- `file` is the name of the file from which data are to be read
- `stringsAsFactors` should generally be set to `TRUE` (all caps): this determines how text-like data in a CSV file is interpreted by R.

---
# R Code Cheat Sheet

## `head(x, n)`

- `x` is a data.frame
- `n` is the number of rows to print

---
# R Code Cheat Sheet

## `str(object)`

- `object` is the R object about which you want to have some information (i.e., see the `str`ucture of).
